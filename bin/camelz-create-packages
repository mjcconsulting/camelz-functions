# The plan is to move this function inside of the camelz-cli eventually. So, this script will serve
# as documentation for the process until that's done. All functions are currently packaged and then
# uploaded to S3 during the creation of a stack containing Lambda Resources which use the S3Bucket
# Code method, so this isn't actually needed for functions, but again documents the process. This
# is needed to create the BaselineLayer.zip, then convert to Base64, so that can be included inthe
# Baseline-Baseline.yaml Template as the BaselineLayer Lambda LayerVersion.
